#Food How

Food how is an experimental Node.js recipe book that uses json files instead of a database for portability. For more information see [troyblank.com](http://troyblank.com/#portfolio:/specimens/2014/foodHow/, "Food How").

## Setup
First thing you want to do is install all node packages run:

    npm install

In order to run the project run:

    npm start

## Adding recipes

When adding recipes it's important to note that underscores will be used in lieu of spaces in file names. For example "Fig_Sauce.json" will show up as "Fig Sauce" to the user.
